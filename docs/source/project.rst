  1. What are you aiming to do?
  _____________________________


  We’re building an interactive  galaxy map with different star systems where each
  planet can be located. After mint we’ll launch staking where every holder can
  build/farm on their planet to terraform in order to get additional traits that
  improves the planet.

  2. How will you achieve this?
  _____________________________

  We’re a community based project, so our mission is to build this together with
  other smol astronomy fans. Our core team consists of 5 people (2 for project
  management, 2 artists, 1 lead solidity dev).
  Our goal is to connect with other projects in the Smolverse in order to have
  some kind of interoperability regarding game experience and farming rewards.

  3. What difference are you making to the space?
  _______________________________________________

  We’re making a difference by dedicating our project to this certain topic,
  while being interoperable with others in the space.
