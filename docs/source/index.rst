SmolPlanets Documentation
=========================


.. note::

   This project and docs are under active development.



1. What are you aiming to do?
_____________________________

We (the founders) are both physics students and astronomy enthusiasts.
We will bring this planet & space experience to Arbi & the smols by launching
a free genesis collection of 4444 planets.
We’re building an interactive  galaxy map with different star systems where each
planet can be located. After mint we’ll launch staking where every holder can
build/farm on their planet to terraform in order to get additional traits that
improves the planet.

2. How will you achieve this?
_____________________________

We’re a community based project, so our mission is to build this together with
other smol astronomy fans. Our core team consists of 5 people (2 for project
management, 2 artists, 1 lead solidity dev).
Our goal is to connect with other projects in the Smolverse in order to have
some kind of interoperability regarding game experience and farming rewards.

3. What difference are you making to the space?
_______________________________________________

We’re making a difference by dedicating our project to this certain topic,
while being interoperable with others in the space.
