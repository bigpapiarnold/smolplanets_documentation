Introduction
************
**Cosmic Secret Society** is a play-to-earn *colony simulator*, built by physics students,
crypto nerds and astronomy enthusiasts. The Art combined with lore and the game create an
immersive experience for all holders. Additionally constant development ensures the
value of the project and a great community.
A Token, built on a strong DeFi Protocoll acts as an ingame currency and a way to
convert your hard earned *$Crystal* to *items* that increase earning and can be traded on
a decentrelized marketplace.



Motivation behind Cosmic Secret Society
*****************************
We (the founders) are physics students and astronomy enthusiasts.
The project shares our experience of exploring strange new worlds and meeting new civilisations,
as the first space dedicated Arbitrum project.
Through complex interoperability with other projects, it will be a place
on Arbitrum, where the smols can meet and play together.



A well structured and dedicated Team; for the good of all
*********************************************************
The CSS development team is a divers and competent team that has experience
in putting great things into practice.
With the core team mostly stationed in central Europe, we ensure maximum work ethics and qualitiy NFTs.
