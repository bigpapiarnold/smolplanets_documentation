SmolPlanets Documentation
#########################

.. note::

   This project and docs are under active development.



Introduction
************
**SmolPlanets** is a play-to-earn *colony simulator*, built by physics students,
crypto nerds and astronomy enthusiasts. The Art combined with lore and the game create an
immersive experience for all holders. Additionally constant development ensures the
value of the project and a great community.
A Token, built on a strong DeFi Protocoll acts as an ingame currency and a way to
convert your hard earned *$Crystal* to *items* that increase earning and can be traded on
a decentrelized marketplace.



Motivation behind SmolPlanets
*****************************
We (the founders) are physics students and astronomy enthusiasts.
The project shares our experience of exploring strange new worlds and meeting new civilisations,
as the first space dedicated Arbitrum project.
Through complex interoperability with other projects, it will be a place
on Arbitrum, where the smols can meet and play together.



A well structured and dedicated Team; for the good of all
*********************************************************
The SmolPlanets development team is a divers and competent team that has experience
in putting great things into practice.
With the core team mostly stationed in central europe




1. What are you aiming to do?
_____________________________


We’re building an interactive  galaxy map with different star systems where each
planet can be located. After mint we’ll launch staking where every holder can
build/farm on their planet to terraform in order to get additional traits that
improves the planet.

2. How will you achieve this?
_____________________________

We’re a community based project, so our mission is to build this together with
other smol astronomy fans. Our core team consists of 5 people (2 for project
management, 2 artists, 1 lead solidity dev).
Our goal is to connect with other projects in the Smolverse in order to have
some kind of interoperability regarding game experience and farming rewards.

3. What difference are you making to the space?
_______________________________________________

We’re making a difference by dedicating our project to this certain topic,
while being interoperable with others in the space.
