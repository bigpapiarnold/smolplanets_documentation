#. Install MetaMask: The first step is to install MetaMask, a browser extension that acts as an Ethereum wallet. You can install it for Google Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or Opera from the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons Store.

#. Create an account: Once you have installed MetaMask, open it and follow the instructions to create a new account. Make sure to backup your seed phrase.

#. Fund your MetaMask wallet: To mint NFTs, you'll need to have some $Magic cryptocurrency in your MetaMask wallet. You can buy $ETH on a cryptocurrency exchange and then transfer it to your MetaMask wallet.

#. Check your whitelist status: Before you visit the "Smolplanets.lol" website, you should check whether you are on the whitelist or not. This will determine the price you need to pay to mint an NFT.

#. Visit the NFT minting website: Open your web browser and go to the "Smolplanets.lol" website.

#. Mint your NFT: After you have connected to MetaMask, you can create your NFT by selecting the "Mint" option on the website. You'll be asked to provide details about your NFT, such as its name and description.

#. Approve the transaction: After you've entered the details of your NFT, you'll be asked to confirm the transaction in MetaMask. Review the details and then confirm the transaction. The amount you need to pay will depend on whether you are whitelisted or not.

#. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed: The transaction will need to be confirmed on the Arbitrum network before your NFT is minted. This can take several minutes.

#. Enjoy your NFT: Once the transaction is confirmed, your NFT will be minted and added to your MetaMask wallet. You can view, trade, and transfer it like any other NFT.
